# Plant immunity through the lens of maize comparative genetics

Maize is one of the major model systems for studying the mechanisms mediating plant immunity against pests and pathogens. Damage to crops caused by pests and pathogens is twofold: yield reduction and potential accumulation of food toxins. Studying maize immunity has been made possible, in a large part, thanks to multiple mapping populations and sequenced genomes that enable us to probe the natural genetic and phenotypic diversity across maize inbreds. One of my research interests is to build upon my experiences working on maize genetics, transcriptomics and metabolomics and expand it to other plant species, including plant species of conservation concern. I am plant biologist and bioinformatician working as a post-doc on maize biosynthesis of defensive specialized metabolites at UC San Diego with Dr. Alisa Huffaker and Dr. Eric Schmelz. I completed my PhD in 2021 in the Huffaker lab where I studied maize responses to signals that mediate anti-herbivore defense responses. For a summary of my past research I include my [CV](assets/pdfs/eporetsky_cv.pdf) and a list of my [publications](research/). The rest of my website is written as a part-blog, part-notebook, demonstrating different bioinformatics-related scripts and workflows, development of data analysis apps, and the construction of [PlantApp.org](https://www.plantapp.org), a comparative genetics database website.
