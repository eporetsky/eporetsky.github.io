Iâ€™m a biologist and bioinformatician with expertise in plant immunity, comparative genomics, and computational protein methods. During my Ph.D. I received my Ph.D. from the Huffaker lab at UC San Diego where I characterized a maize anti-herbivory receptor, peptide hormones, and metabolomic biosynthetic pathways. Currently, I am a post-doc with the USDA GrainGenes group, where I apply state-of-the-art methods in protein structure prediction, protein language models and molecular docking to improve protein function annotation through prediction of protein phosphorylation, protein-protein interactions, and protein-ligand interactions. More information about my research, incluing a CV and a list of citations, can be found at the `Research` tab on the left.
