Movements and confirmational changes within proteins are important for understanding protein function. Common methods for studying protein dynamics include molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and normal model analyses (NMA). Deep learning methods have also been applied to probe protein dynamics.

## ProDy

A collection of tools for studying different aspects of protein dynamics. I am preparing a more detailed walkthrough, looking more closely at the structural dynamics of a crystal structure of terpene synthase (TPS). Updates will be included in the Bioinformatics tab.
