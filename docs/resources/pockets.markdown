Pocket detection in protein structures is important for understanding protein function and regulation, and finding possible druggable sites. As such, there are a lot of different packages and online servers that can be used. From my brief survey of published work, it seems to me that many packages either don't work out of the box, do not provide source code or are behind a proprietary academic/commercial licensing. Perhaps even more so when looking at method used protein pocket similarity comparisons. While the list I'm compiling below is not going to be comprehensive, I am going to add some links to reviews that survey the available methods in the field. See my [PlantDiffucion/pockets](https://github.com/eporetsky/PlantDiffusion/tree/main/pockets) GitHub page to find additional instructions and Docker files for running protein pocket prediction and comparison methods. For convenience, the table of content is split into two related sections: (A) protein pocket detection methods and (B) protein pocket similarity comparison methods.

## (A) P2Rank

Fast and easy to use protein pocket detection method. It took ~2 hours to analyze ~30k PDB files using 12 CPU threads.

[PrankWeb](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/50/W1/W593/6591527?login=false) is an online server for detecting and visualizing pockets: <br>

## (A) fpocket

fpocket is another tool that I am planning to use for protein pocket prediction in the near future. Also worth checking [MDPocket](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/27/23/3276/234086) for tracking pockets in molecular dynamics trajectories.

## (A) SiteFerret

I created a Docker env for SiteFerret but I run into errors when trying to predict pockets on a PDB file. I am not planning on spending more time on this for the time being.

## (B) PPS-align

Easy to use, but somewhat slow, pocket similarity comparison method.

It seems like PPS-align doesn't have a manuscript at this point and [LS-align](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29462237/) might be alternative paper to cite for the time being. 

Online web server and source code are available through: <br>
https://zhanggroup.org/PPS-align/

## (B) PDBspheres

I did not try this one but it looks interesting:

## (B) Pocket Similarity: Are Î± Carbons Enough?

I generally prefer to avoid manuscripts that don't include source code implementation for their methods but it doesn't seem like this one could be a fun exercise to re-implement.
