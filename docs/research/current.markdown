## PhosBoost

PhosBoost is a machine learning approach that leverages protein language models and gradient boosting trees to predict protein phosphorylation from experimentally derived data. PhosBoost offers improved performance when recall is prioritized while consistently providing more confident probability scores.

The open-access PhosBoost manuscript is now available in [Plant Direct](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pld3.554).
