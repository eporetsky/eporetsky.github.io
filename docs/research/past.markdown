During my Ph.D. in the Huffaker lab and a Post-doc in the Schmelz lab at UC San Diego, I conducted research on different aspects of plant immune responses against pests and disease. My work focused on understanding the maize perception of endogenous peptide hormones and herbivore-associated molecular patterns, and studying a class of antibiotic specialized root metabolites and their role in mediating interaction with root microbes. I have also contributed on a number of research projects, providing extensive bioinformatics analysis results and conducting experiments. As part of my bioinformatics work, I have analyzed analyzed RNA-seq data, constructed phylogenetic trees, conducted QTL and GWAS mapping, used variant calling to generate an improved SNP-based genetic map, and generated comparative genomic analyses of syntenic gene clusters. I have also built a Shiny web-application for Mutual Rank-based gene coexpression analysis, named [MutRank](https://github.com/eporetsky/MutRank), that was instrumental in elucidiating the biosynthetic pathways of maize specialized metabolism.
