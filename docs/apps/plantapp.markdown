PlantApp is Python Dash-based website that I started working on in 2021 with the goal of creating a protein sequence-centric database for comparative genomics in plants with an easy-to-use interface. I have included more detailed information in the [research/PlantApp page](https://eporetsky.github.io/research/plantapp), and you can follow the links below to the website and to the GitHub page were the code for the website is available.
