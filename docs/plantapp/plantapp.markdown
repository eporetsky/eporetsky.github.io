## Motivation

The guiding principle behind  [PlantApp](https://www.plantapp.org/) is to bring biologists closer to the data. PlantApp integrates data from publicly-available genomics databases and provides fast and simple search options.      

## Genomics Datasets

Discover what [available datasets](https://www.plantapp.org/SQNce/available_dbs/) are currently on PlantApp. Datassets from new species, genotypes and of different information will be continously added.

### Availability

A list of the original files and their source will be included. The processed files used by PlantApp will be made available to download, including the method to re-generate these files.

### Requests

### Citations

PlantApp would not have been possible without great effort of multiple groups and organizations to sequence and annotate plant genomes. A list of proper citations for each genome will be generated.
