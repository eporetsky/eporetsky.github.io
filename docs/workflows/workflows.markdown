## The bioinformatics-workflows repository

As part of my research I have conducted different types of analyses, including transcriptomic, metabolomic, phylogenetic and genetic mapping analyses. In the process, I have accumulated many script files and notebooks that are stored in my github repository: [bioinformatics-workflows](https://github.com/eporetsky/bioinformatics-workflows). In general, more recent additions are better commented, and the content of the repository will be continously updated and improved. Additionaly, parts of the repository will be exapnded in mmore detail in the sections below.
