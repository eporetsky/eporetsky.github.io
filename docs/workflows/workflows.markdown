## Bioinformatics workflows

I am learning how to use Snakemake to create reproducible bioinformatics data analysis workflows. The latest snakemake files can be found in my github bioinformatics-repo repository in the [snakemake folder](https://https://github.com/eporetsky/bioinformatics-repo/tree/master/snakemake). Additional information for specific workflows is provided in the specific sections below.
