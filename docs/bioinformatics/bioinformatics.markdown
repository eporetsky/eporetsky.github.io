## The bioinformatics-repo

I maintain most of my scripts in a single github repository: [bioinformatics-repo](https://github.com/eporetsky/bioinformatics-repo). The repository contains the scripts, notebooks and comments relating to different types of bioifnromatics analyses. While some of the analyses were used to generate data for published manuscripts, many others ended up being less useful. All are included, with little discrimination. The content of the repository will be continously updated and improved and some parts will be featured here.
